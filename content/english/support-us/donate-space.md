Techqueria events are usually held at different tech companies across the US.

Donating space for Techqueria events provides a great opportunity for our members to get a peek of your company environment while also supporting the growth and advancement of our members.

The number of attendees varies - from 20 to 200+ with most events happening on evenings during the week from 6 to 9 pm.

As a host, you commit to providing the following:

- catering & space up for our attendees
- a company representative to initially welcome the group and introduce the company (ideally, they identify as Latinx)
- (optional) [a shared channel](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004151203-Create-shared-channels-on-a-workspace-beta-) between Techqueria's Slack Workspace and your company's Slack Workspace

> If you're interested in donating space, please fill out the form below.
>
> We'll get back to you if we have a need for your space which may not be immediately.
>
> In the meantime, feel free to [request an invite to our Slack community](/slack).
