We're going to have speakers from different backgrounds talk to us about their experiences, their ideas for the future and their opinion of the eCommerce landscape. There will be Q&A sessions after each presentation, so come with a curious mind.

Before and after the presentations, there will be networking-style mixers, so be prepared to share business cards, resumes, LinkedIn profiles, portfolios, and your brightest personalities.
