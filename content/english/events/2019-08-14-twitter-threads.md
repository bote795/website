Clear your calendar!

We're having an open-mic night in partnership with Techqueria to talk about what it's like being Latinx in Tech.

We'll keep the conversation on Twitter going as we live-tweet questions and get a global perspective.

Join us in person for good food, community, and conversation!

Follow us @TwitterAlas and join the global conversation using the hashtag #LatinxTechTwitter.

`#ElPasoStrong`

An opportunity to come together across the nation

In light of the recent shooting in El Paso, we want to provide the opportunity for members and allies of the community to show their support by contributing to the El Paso Community Foundation fund.

Donations are not necessary to attend the event but every little bit helps show our love and support for affected families.
