There are a lot of latinos in tech in the bay area, however more efforts can be made to keep us in touch, and form a stronger community. Let's start by having some beer and pizza together.

The idea of this group is to provide a space where we can share our goals, ideas, make new friends and find ways in which we can work together to reach higher, I don't know yet how are we gonna do that, but I'm sure that among us there are some great ideas.

All ideas are welcome, we want to come up with topics for the events, good communications channels, frequency, locations, sponsors, other organizers, etc.

See you soon!
